## Theoretical background

We assume our stochastic oscillator can be described by a Langevin equation

$$\frac{d\textbf{x}}{dt}=\textbf{f}(\textbf{x}) + \textbf{g}(\textbf{x})\xi(t), \qquad \textbf{x} \in \mathbb{R},$$

where $\textbf{f}$ is a is an n-dimensional vector, $\textbf{g}$ is an $n \times n$ matrix, and $\xi$
is $n$-dimensional white noise with uncorrelated components, so it satisfies, $\left\langle \xi_i(t)\xi_j(t') \right\rangle  = \delta(t-t')\delta_{i,j}$.

The process described by the previous Langevin equation is a $n$-dimensional Markov process, that is uniquely determined by the transition probability density $P(\textbf{x},t | \textbf{y},s)$ (for $t>s$). This central statistics satisfies both the forward Kolmogorov (or ``Fokker-Planck'') equation 

$$\frac{\partial P}{\partial t}=\mathcal{L}[P]=-\nabla_\textbf{x}\cdot\left( \textbf{f}(\textbf{x}) P \right)+ \sum_{i,j}\frac{\partial^2}{\partial x_i x_j}\left(D_{ij}(\textbf{x})P\right), $$

$where ~ D=\frac12 gg^\intercal$. 

Here the functional $\mathcal{L}^\dagger$ acts with respect to the $\textbf{x}$ coordinates. $P(\textbf{x},t | \textbf{y},s)$  also obeys the backward Kolmogorov equation 

```math
-\frac{\partial P}{\partial s} = \mathcal{L}^\dagger [P]=\textbf{f}(\textbf{y})\nabla_\textbf{y}\left(P \right)+\sum_{i,j}D_{ij}(\textbf{y})\frac{\partial^2 P}{\partial y_i y_j} 
```
where the operator $\mathcal{L}^\dagger$ acts with respect to the $\textbf{y}$ coordinates.

Here we assume a discrete set of eigenvalues $\lambda=\mu_\lambda+i\omega_\lambda$ with corresponding forward ($\mathcal{L}$) and backwards ($\mathcal{L}^\dagger$) eigenfunctions
```math
\mathcal{L}[P_\lambda]=\lambda P_\lambda,\qquad\mathcal{L}^\dagger [Q^*_{\lambda}]=\lambda Q^*_{\lambda},
```
where the smallest eigenvalue is $\lambda_0$, corresponds to the stationary state, which we denote $P_0(\textbf{x})$ and assume to be unique.


## How to use the code?

The code considers a 2D stochastic SDE and a rectangular domain. In particular, it should generate results for the "noisy Stuart-Landau" model in 

Whereas the library "kolmogorovTools.py" contains the functions computing the terms composing $\mathcal{L}^\dagger$, the script "diagonalizeKolmogorov.py" builds the operator for the model of interest and provides the set of eigenfunctions and eigenvalues for ($\mathcal{L}$) and ($\mathcal{L}^\dagger$).
- Make sure both functions are at the same directory  
- Open "diagonalizeKolmogorov.py", define your functions $f_x (x,y)$ and $f_y (x,y)$, then choose the domain you aim to discretise and how many points you want in each direction (params N,M)
- Then, execute it and enjoy your eigenfunctions :)
- As tip: chose a domain large enough so the probability of trajectory reaching the boundaries is low.
- The matrices in the code are written following sparse scipy libraries. This way one can consider big number of points to discretise without running out of memory.
- How many points to use when discrtising? Well, try and error will teach you to find a good compromise (whereas few points may generate weird results, choosing too many points may cause the code to be too slow)

## What produces?

By running the code you will generate the files containing the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the forward and backward operators. The eigenvectors you obtain correspond to the eigenfunctions exaluated on the chosen grid. As the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions are computed via the scipy routine "eigs", we refer to [[scipy.eigs documentation]](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.sparse.linalg.eigs.html) for information about how they are stored.
